The rationale given was “they’re both herbs” and “quite similar” (!). We were less than impressed. To their credit, they took it off the bill and even brought us the original lemon-basil sorbet to try separately and it was EXQUISITE. Shame we didn’t take a photo so we could rate it as a separate dessert."

Half of it was overly sweet soft meringue, the other half very mediocre Tres Leches cake, and their sum was not greater than its parts, but quite the opposite. The fruits at the top were the tastiest of its layers, which is pretty sad. I think it might actually be the worst Tres Leches cake I’ve ever had, which sounds strong but before this, I’ve never liked one so little that I left more than half uneaten."
